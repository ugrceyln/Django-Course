    "Django looks for templates in each of your app's directories by seeking out any directory called \"templates.\" It then builds a list of templates, and will grab the one that matches (or throw an error if none do). The problem is, sometimes, templates will have the same name, because you forgot the names of all of the templates in some other app that maybe you wrote a while ago, or it's someone else's that you've brought in. Anyway, the way we handle for this is to actually have a directory inside of our templates directory called the same as our app name. So, let's make a new directory called templates at mysite/main/templates, then, inside of that, add another directory called main, so you will have mysite/main/templates/main/. Head there, and make a file inside called home.html. Now we can add some HTML here, along with our object. Django has its own templating, which is *similar* to Jinja, but some things are indeed different. To begin, let's just make this page iterate over all of our tutorials so far and display them.\n",
