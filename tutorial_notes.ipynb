    "Alright, assuming you have Django installed, let's get started! With your installation of Django, you should now have a command line keyword: django-admin. You can use this to start a new project. Django considers all websites to be a collection of apps. Consider a website that has a forum, a shop, and a blog. Each of those three things would be considered its own \"app.\" A collection of these apps is your project. So, let's start a project. In your terminal/cmd.exe, do:\n",
    "`django-admin startproject mysite`\n",
    "The startproject command will create a new directory called whatever you called your project, In our case, that's called mysite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so with this in mind, let's add our first actual app to our project. To do this, we will use manage.py. This is a helper python script that will allow you to do things within your project. First, we'll use it to create another app. In your terminal/command line, navigate to the dir where this manage.py file is, then do:\n",
    "`python3 manage.py startapp main`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see that a new directory has been created called main. So now the top levels of your project's structure are something like:\n",

    "    -main (directory, your \"primary\" app)\n",
    "    -mysite (directory, this is your new app)\n",
    "    -manage.py (helper python script)\n",
